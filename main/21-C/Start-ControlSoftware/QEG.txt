QEG GUI

This is the GUI that launches the experimental control software. It is called via the command
QEG

The user can choose which instrument should be used as pulse sequencer (Pulse Blaster or AWG) and, additionally, if
all instruments should be simulated (situation when code needs to be developed away from the laboratory).

Preferences are set as soon as the QEG GUI is launched. One can also set the preferences manually by
using the command:
setpref('nv')

Preferences are removed using the command:
rmpref('nv')
