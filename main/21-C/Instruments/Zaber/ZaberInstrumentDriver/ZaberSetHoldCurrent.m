function [ret err] = ZaberSetHoldCurrent(device, devNr, currentDivider)
% SetHoldCurrent - Sets the desired current to be used when the device is
% holding its position.
% 
% It is typical to run stepper motors at their rated current only during
% moves (for highest torque) and reduce the current when idle just to hold the position.
% 
% Typically the hold current can be set to around 25 - 50% of the running
% current. In some applications, the friction of the drive system alone is
% sufficient to hold the microstep position of the motor, and the hold
% current can be turned off completely. The hold current can be turned off
% by issuing the "Set Hold Current" instruction with data of 0.
% 
% When the device is moving, it applies running current to the motor. When
% the device stops moving, running current is applied for an additional 0.1
% second before hold current is applied.
% 
% The current is related to the data by the formula:
%     Current = CurrentCapacity * 10 / CommandData 
% 
% The range of accepted values is 0 (no current), 10 (max) - 127 (min).
% CurrentCapacity is the hardware's maximum capability of output current.
% 
% To prevent damage, some devices limit the maximum output current to a
% lower value. In that case the valid range is 0, Limit - 127. Current
% limits are listed under the device specifications.
% 
% Some devices limit the voltage rather than the current. In this case the
% same formula can be used by replacing Current and CurrentCapacity with
% Voltage and PowerSupplyVoltage.
% 
% For example, Suppose you connect a stepper motor rated for 420mA per
% phase to a T-CD2500. Reversing the equation above and using 420mA as
% Current gives:
% 
% CommandData
%     = 10 * CurrentCapacity / Current 
%     = 10 * 2500mA / 420mA 
%     = 59.5 (round to 60) 
% 
% Therefore CommandData = 60.
