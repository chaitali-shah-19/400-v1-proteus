function [ret err] = ZaberSetDeviceMode(device, devNr, mode)
% SetDeviceMode - Sets the Mode for the given device.
% 
% This command allows setting several options. Each option is controlled by
% a single bit within the command data. Most software you will encounter,
% including most of our demo software, represents all 4 data bytes as a
% single decimal value rather than specifying each bit individually. To
% determine what decimal value to use requires a basic understanding of how
% the data is represented in binary. The command data may be considered as
% a single 32-bit binary value. The least significant bit is bit_0, the
% next is bit_1, the next is bit_2, and so on up to the most significant
% bit_31. Each bit may have a value of either 1 or 0.
% 
% The corresponding decimal representation of this 32-bit data is given by:
%     Decimal value = (bit_0 * 1) + (bit_1 * 2) + … + (bit_31 * 2^31) 
% 
% Each bit controls a single mode option as described in the table below.
% To determine the data value to use with the Set Device Mode command,
% simply determine the desired value of each bit (1 or 0), and calculate
% the decimal value using the above formula. Note that not all 32 bits 
% are currently used. Any unused or reserved bits should be left as 0.
% 
% For example, suppose you want all mode bits to be 0 except for bit_3 
% (disable potentiometer), bit_14 (disable power LED), and bit_15 
% (disable serial LED). The Set Device Mode instruction should be sent 
% with data calculated as follows:
% 
%     Command Data
%         = 2^3 + 2^14 + 2^15 
%         = 8 + 16384 + 32768 
%         = 49160 
% 
% Note that each instance of the Set Device Mode command overwrites ALL
% previous mode bits. Repeated commands do not have a cumulative effect.
% For example, suppose you send a Set Device Mode command with data of 8 
% to disable the potentiometer. If you then send another Set Device Mode 
% command with data of 16384 to disable the power LED, you will re-enable 
% the potentiometer since bit_3 in the 2nd instruction is 0.
% 
% Most devices have a default mode setting of 0 (all bits are 0), however, 
% there are some exceptions. See Appendix A of the user manual for a table 
% of default settings.
