% SetLockState - Locks or unlocks all non-volatile settings. 
% 
% Sometimes it is desirable to lock all non-volatile settings to prevent
% them from being changed inadvertently. After changing all settings as
% desired, settings can be locked by setting the Lock State to 1. Subsequent
% attempts to change any non-volatile setting (e.g., Set Target Speed,
% command 42) will result in an error response with an error code of 3600
% (settings locked). Note that the Set Lock State command does not apply
% to commands and settings that are specific to the joystick. Load Event
% Instruction and Set Axis Device Number for example, are unaffected by the
% Lock State.
% 
% How the Restore Settings instruction behaves when the settings are locked
% depends on the firmware version. In version 5.07 issuing a Restore
% Settings instruction while the settings are locked will result in an
% error response with an error code of 3600 (settings locked). This
% behavior was found to confuse many customers so in version 5.08 and up,
% the behavior was changed such that regardless of the current lock state,
% issuing a Restore Settings instruction will always return setting values
% to factory default values and leave settings in an unlocked state.
% 
% Settings can also be unlocked by setting the Lock State to 0.
