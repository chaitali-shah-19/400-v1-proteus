function [ret err] = ZaberSetRunningCurrent(device, devNr, currentDivider)
% SetRunningCurrent - Sets the desired current to be used when the device
% is moving. 
% 
% If your application does not require high torque, it is best to decrease
% the driving current to reduce power consumption, vibration, and motor
% heating. Trial and error should suggest an appropriate setting. If higher
% torque is required, it is generally safe to overdrive motors as long as
% they are not operated continuously. Motor temperature is typically the
% best indication of the degree to which overdriving can be employed. If
% the motor gets too hot to touch (>75°C), you should reduce the running
% current.
% 
% The current is related to the data by the formula:
%     Current = CurrentCapacity * 10 / CommandData 
% 
% The range of accepted values is 0 (no current), 10 (max) - 127 (min).
% CurrentCapacity is the hardware's maximum capability of output current.
% 
% To prevent damage, some devices limit the maximum output current to a
% lower value. In that case the valid range is 0, Limit - 127. Current
% limits are listed under the device specifications.
% 
% Some devices limit the voltage rather than the current. In this case the
% same formula can be used by replacing Current and CurrentCapacity with
% Voltage and PowerSupplyVoltage.
% 
% For example, Suppose you connect a stepper motor rated for 420mA per
% phase to a T-CD2500. Reversing the equation above and using 420mA as
% Current gives:
% 
% CommandData
%     = 10 * CurrentCapacity / Current 
%     = 10 * 2500mA / 420mA 
%     = 59.5 (round to 60) 
% 
% Therefore CommandData = 60. 
%
