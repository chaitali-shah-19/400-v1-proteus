function [ret err] = ZaberMoveAtConstantSpeed(device, devNr, speed)
% MoveAtConstantSpeed - Moves the device at a constant speed based on the
% value specified in the Command Data.
% 
% This instruction specifies a direction and a speed to move, rather than
% a target position. When this instruction is issued the device will
% accelerate (at a rate determined by command #43 Set Acceleration) to the
% speed specified by the instruction data. The device will continue moving
% at this speed until a limit is reached or a pre-empting instruction is
% issued. Negative speeds cause retraction while positive speeds cause
% extension. Unlike the other movement commands, this command sends a
% response immediately without waiting for the move to finish.
% 
% The device may be set to return its position continuously during the move
% using the set mode command (#40)] bit 4. Position tracking is a
% reply-only command #8. If the device runs into zero position or maximum
% range, the device stops and the new position is returned via reply-only
% command #9.
% 
% This command may pre-empt, or be pre-empted by commands 18, 20, 21, 22
% and 23.
% 
% For a spreadsheet that can be used to calculate speed setting values for
% any product see http://www.zaber.com/documents/ZaberSpeedSetting.xls.
% Alternatively you may use the formulas below.
% 
% Actual Speed
%     = Data * 9.375 * M mm/s or deg/s 
%     = Data * 9.375 microsteps/s 
%     = Data * 9.375 / R steps/s 
%     = Data * 9.375 / (R x S) * 60 revolutions/min Motor rpm 
%     = Data * 9.375 * L / (R x S) mm/s Linear devices only 
% 	
% where:
%     Data is the value of the command data
%     R (microsteps/step) is the microstep resolution (command 37)
%     S (steps/revolution) is the number of steps per motor revolution
%     M (mm or deg) is the microstep size
%     L (mm or deg) is the distance of linear motion per motor revolution 
% 
% Maximum data value is 512*R-1. Note that the maximum speed possible is
% independent of the resolution. In Firmware 5.21 and 5.22, a value of 0
% is not allowed. In all other versions, target speed of 0 will cause Move
% Absolute/Relative and Move to Stored Position commands to return an error.
% 
% Refer to product specifications for the distance corresponding to a
% single microstep or revolution.
% 
% For example, if a motor has 48 steps per revolution (S = 48), used with
% default resolution (R = 64), and Data is 2922, then the motor will move
% at a speed of approximately 535 revolutions per minute.
