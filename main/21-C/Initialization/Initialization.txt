Initialization Folder

There should be one folder for each experimental setup. Each folder should contain 2 files named
exactly Imaging_InitScript.m and Experiment_InitScript.m .

The preference as to which folder should be used for each experimental setup is set along with the other preferences when the QEG GUI is
launched.
